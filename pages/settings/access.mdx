# File Access Settings

You can control the visibility of files uploaded or listed through Drive Explorer Pro. These options are available under the **Settings** tab within the sidebar.

## Access Levels

- **Only me (private)**  
  Files are accessible only to your Google account. They will not be visible to anyone else, even if shared via link.

- **My organization**  
  Files can be viewed by anyone within your Google Workspace domain who has the link.

- **Anyone with the link**  
  Files are publicly viewable by anyone with the link. This is suitable for publicly shared content.
