# Listing Files in the Spreadsheet

Once you have configured your insertion point and selected file attributes, you can proceed to list files directly from Google Drive into your spreadsheet.

## How to List Files

To begin listing:

1. In the sidebar, click the blue button labeled **“Select existing files from Drive and List in Sheet.”**
2. A Google Drive file picker will appear, allowing you to select one or more files.
3. Click **Select** to confirm your choices.
4. The selected file details will be inserted into the sheet using the selected structure and format.

## Understanding the File Picker Options

The file picker provides three tabs, each serving a distinct purpose:

- **Google Drive (All Files)**  
  This tab displays all folders and files in your Google Drive. You can navigate through your folder structure and select files from any location.

- **Google Drive (Default Folder)**  
  If a default folder has been set using Drive Explorer Pro, this tab shows the contents of that specific folder. It enables quick access to files that you commonly use.

- **Shared Drives**  
  If your Google account has access to Shared Drives, this tab allows you to select files from shared team environments.

 Each tab helps streamline file selection based on your workflow, whether personal, predefined, or collaborative.

> The listed files will appear as rows in the spreadsheet, with each attribute displayed in a separate column. File data will be inserted according to the chosen method: either starting from the selected cell or appended below existing data.
