# Select File Attributes to List

When listing files from Google Drive into your spreadsheet, you can choose which file attributes to include. These attributes determine the type and format of information that will be inserted into the sheet.

You may select one or more of the following options:

• **Image Preview**  
 Inserts a small thumbnail preview of the file, if supported by the file type (e.g., images or Google Docs).

• **File Name Linked to URL**  
 Displays the file name as a clickable hyperlink that opens the file in Google Drive.

• **Direct Download Link**  
 Provides a link that initiates a direct download of the file when clicked.

• **File Name**  
 Displays the plain text name of the file, without any link or formatting.

• **File URL**  
 Inserts the full web address (URL) to the file on Google Drive.

• **File ID**  
 Inserts the unique identifier assigned to the file by Google Drive.

• **MIME Type**  
 Displays the file's MIME type (e.g., `application/pdf`, `image/png`, `application/vnd.google-apps.document`), which helps identify its format.

• **File Size (MB)**  
 Shows the size of the file in megabytes, rounded to two decimal places.
