# Start Listing Files From a Selected Cell

Before listing files in your Google Sheet, you must choose where the data should be inserted. This setting determines the starting point for populating file details retrieved from Google Drive.

Drive Explorer Pro provides two options:

---

## 1. Currently Selected Cell

If this option is selected, the file list will be inserted starting from the cell that is currently active in the spreadsheet.

### Recommended Use Cases:

- When you need precise control over the insertion point.
- When you are manually organizing or formatting data around the inserted content.
- When inserting file listings in multiple parts of the sheet.

**Example:**  
If cell `B3` is selected, the listing will begin at `B3` and expand downward and to the right based on the number of selected file attributes.

**Note:**  
Ensure there is sufficient empty space to avoid overwriting existing content in adjacent cells.

  style={{
    background: "#f0f9ff",
    border: "3px solid #90cdf4",
    borderRadius: "10px",
    padding: "16px",
    boxShadow: "0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)",
    display: "inline-block",
    marginBottom: "1rem",
  }}

    alt="Install Drive Explorer Pro"
    style={{ borderRadius: "6px", maxWidth: "100%" }}
  />
</div>

## 2. Append Below Existing Data

If this option is selected, Drive Explorer Pro automatically detects the last non-empty row and inserts the new file list immediately after it.

### Recommended Use Cases:

- When maintaining a growing list of files.
- When appending new entries over time.
- When the existing sheet content should remain unmodified.

**Example:**  
If there are already ten rows of data, the new listing will begin from row 11, regardless of which cell is currently selected.

**Note:**  
This approach is well-suited for incremental updates and ongoing logs.
