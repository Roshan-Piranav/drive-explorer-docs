# Frequently Asked Questions

Below are answers to common questions about using Drive Explorer Pro inside Google Sheets.

---

### Can I upload or list multiple files at once?

Yes. Drive Explorer Pro supports uploading or listing multiple files in a single action.

- **For uploading**, you can drag and drop several files into the upload area or select them using the file picker.
- **For listing**, you can select multiple files at once from any folder using the integrated Drive picker.

This allows for efficient bulk operations without repeating steps.

---

### Can I upload or list an entire folder?

No. You cannot upload or list an entire folder directly.

However, you can **open the folder**, select **all files inside it**, and then upload or list them. This provides the same result in just a few clicks.

---

### Do I need to set a default folder before listing or uploading?

Setting a default folder is optional.

You can list or upload files from any folder manually each time. However, using a default folder helps save time by pre-selecting a working directory for consistent file operations.

---

### Can I customize what information gets listed for each file?

Yes. Drive Explorer Pro allows you to choose the file attributes you want to include, such as:

- File name  
- Image preview  
- File URL  
- Download link  
- File ID  
- MIME type  
- File size

These preferences can be saved as default for future listings.

---

### Will changing the sheet affect previously listed data?

No. Drive Explorer Pro will not overwrite existing data unless it’s inserted in the same range.

To avoid this, use the **“Append Below Existing Data”** option when listing files, which ensures new entries are added beneath existing ones.

---

### Who can access the files I upload?

Access permissions can be configured under the **Settings** tab. You may choose from:

- **Only me (private)**  
- **My organization**  
- **Anyone with the link**

These settings apply at the time of upload and help control visibility of your Drive content.
