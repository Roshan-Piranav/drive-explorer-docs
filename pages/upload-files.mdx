## How to Upload Files

- **Select Files**  
  You can either drag and drop files into the upload panel or click inside the upload area to open a file picker. Selected files will appear in a list below, showing their name and size.

- **Preview and Manage Selections**  
  Enable the checkbox **"Show preview of selected file(s)"** to display thumbnail previews (when supported). You can remove individual files by clicking the red X icon or clear all files using the **Clear selected files** option.

- **Upload and Insert**  
  Once the files are selected, click **Upload files to Drive and list in Sheets**.  
  The files will be uploaded to the default Google Drive folder previously set. Immediately after uploading, their details will be inserted into the sheet based on your selected file attributes.

To update the upload destination, click the **Change** button next to the folder name.

> To preserve your current selections and folder as default for future sessions, click Save selected settings as Default.
